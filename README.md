# Installation

`git clone https://github.com/1nspir3d/civitta-test-task.git`

`cd civitta-test-task`

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

From this point you can either run the app on the Android emulator or iOS simulator (if you're on macOS).</br>You can also use a physical device but you need to install Expo GO first and then simply scan the QR code from the terminal
